## Description

This app could be made with any framework or language, I chose to use Ruby on Rails, mostly due to familiarity even though it might be a bit much for this project.

Click the start button.  Every 5 seconds, a letter and number combination will be called.  Click it off the board and yell bingo when you get one!
